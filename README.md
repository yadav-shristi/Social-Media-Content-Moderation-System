Content Moderation System

Overview:

The project is a machine learning-based web application that detects toxic, abusive, or harmful text content.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a multi-label classification model to analyze user input in real time.
This system is designed to simulate how modern social media platforms moderate user-generated content.

 Objectives:
Detect harmful and toxic content automatically
Classify text into multiple categories

Features:
User Login
Multi-label Classification into categories:
1. Toxic
2. Severe Toxic
3. Obscene
4. Threat
5. Insult
6. Identity Hate
Analytics Dashboard of content

Workflow:
1. User enters text in the Streamlit UI
2. Text is sent to FastAPI via API request
3. Backend processes text using TF-IDF
4. Model predicts toxicity probabilities
5. Results are returned to frontend
6. Output is displayed and logged

Tech Stack:
Programming: Python
Machine Learning:
1) Scikit-learn
2) TF-IDF Vectorizer
3) Logistic Regression
Data Processing:
Pandas
NumPy
Web Frameworks:
Streamlit (Frontend)
FastAPI (Backend)
Visualization:
Matplotlib

5. Admin role-based access system

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can be used to build scalable and real-time content moderation systems, similar to those used by modern digital platforms.

Note: 

This project is developed for educational purposes and demonstrates the application of AI in content moderation systems.
